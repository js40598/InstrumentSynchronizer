# InstrumentSynchronizer

Done: 
    file converter, 
    spectrum extractor, 
    BPM detector, 
    read_audio_samples gets 2 separate tables and has to be more efficient (.T),
    metronome generator,
    Get more samples to try out if BPM detector works well, 

To do: 
    Try different win_s and hop_s and create sets to make app more efficient, 
    Go on with app functions, not only reading files,
    Beats coords saved in tab and used to make them synchronize with others?
