# InstrumentSynchronizer

Done: 
    file converter, 
    spectrum extractor, 
    BPM detector, 
    read_audio_samples gets 2 separate tables and has to be more efficient (.T),
    metronome generator,
    Get more samples to try out if BPM detector works well, 
    Try different win_s and hop_s and create sets to make app more efficient,
    ^(256, 16 works for bpm 60-180)

To do:  
    Find more efficient way to find bpm,
    Go on with app functions, not only reading files,
    Beats coords saved in tab and used to make them synchronize with others?
