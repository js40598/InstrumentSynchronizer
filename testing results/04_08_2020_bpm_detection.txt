* Known issue: Panned tracks higher than 180bpm ping-pong from side to side.
# That might be the reason why 180+BPM samples detected BPM is halved
# No clue why 61BPM is detected as 51BPM, might be sample issue as well
# Anyway will have to check this up later or try with some not randomly downloaded samples
# Executed as:
#
#for key, value in samples.items():
#    a = AudioFile(value)
#    start_time = time.time()
#    a.read_audio_samples()
#    a.display_plot(0, 1)
#    bpm = get_file_bpm(a.directory, params={'win_s': 128,
#                                            'hop_s': 32,
#                                            'samplerate': a.framerate
#                                            })
#    print('BPM expected: ', key, '\nBPM detected: ', bpm)
#    print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))
